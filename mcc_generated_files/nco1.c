   @File Name
     nco1.c

   @Summary
     This is the generated driver implementation file for the NCO1 driver using
   PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

   @Description
     This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for NCO1.
     Generation Information :
         Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.8
         Device            :  PIC16F18426
         Driver Version    :  2.11
     The generated drivers are tested against the following:
         Compiler          :  XC8 2.36 and above or later
         MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 6.00
